to set up this project, create a virtual env and install everything in requirements.txt while virtualenv is activated or specifying using "pip install -E /path/to/env -r /path/to/requirements.txt"

make sure there's a localsettings.py and socialauth_settings.py in the project directory (look at samples and rename accordingly)
